Working through [https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md]

Acquired electron with: `npm install electron-prebuilt --save-dev`

Copied the "scripts" section with its "start" task from another project.

Adding a packager/builder tool: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-builder] with: `npm install --save-dev electron-builder`

* Todo: add icons to `./build/` as described in `electron-builder`'s quick setup guide.
